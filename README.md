# Ilia Kaziamov

I am a Backend Developer **with 3+ years of experience** and have been working in teams ranging from 3 to 31 members, both remotely and on-site. I have 2 years of mentoring experience. I have built the full cycle of development: from gathering product owner requirements to establishing a fully automated release process with high test coverage, detailed analytics, and continuous integration/delivery. I am passionate about backend development and interested in e-commerce services. In my free time, I build a technical community for beginner developers and create content for my blog and YouTube channel.

I am seeking a product-oriented company that values a strong engineering culture, including practices like TDD and CI/CD

## About


The beginning of my career was working in a small online store in Krasnoyarsk (Siberia). I was fascinated by working with clients and improving order picking and delivery algorithms.

As an online store manager, I have been involved in sales and customer service for 2 regional and 3 federal online stores for 6 years.

After that, I began to look for opportunities to work remotely and influence processes more, so I started freelancing in the field of social media marketing and graphic design.

Over time, I rethought my career and realized that I was fascinated by the technical side of online sales and I began training as a developer.
